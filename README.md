# AsteroTracker App

I have been a fan f the universe since my early childhood. I remember, I used to look up in the sky and wonder how many stars and cellestial objects are out there. One day, I browsed through a list of free APIs and I've come across the NASA API. So, I decided to utilize its power and combine it with my React skills to produce the AsteroTracker app.

AsteroTracker is a service for near earth Asteroid information. It uses data from NASA and displays upcoming, current and recent asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth.

Every visitor can search for asteroids, look up a specific asteroid, as well as browse the overall data-set.

Tech Used:

- React
- Redux
- Styled Components
- Figma
- All the images and assets found on the internet (not made by me!)
